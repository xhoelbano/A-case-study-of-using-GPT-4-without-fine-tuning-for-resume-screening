# Ethical concerns of LLMs in HR systems:  A case study of using GPT-4 without fine-tuning for resume screening
This paper investigates the ethical implications of using GPT-4 for resume screening in human resources (HR) systems. With AI's growing influence in automating hiring practices, concerns about introducing biases have increased significantly. The study employs a case study methodology, crafting and analyzing pairs of resumes that differ only in demographic indicators such as ethnicity, gender, and race to explore GPT-4's potential biases in evaluating candidates without any custom fine-tuning. Our findings indicate that while GPT-4 did not exhibit explicit biases in its feedback or language, variations in scoring among nearly identical resumes raised questions regarding implicit biases.
